in TypeScript 4.1, such as template literal types, key remapping in mapped types, and recursive conditional types, are part of the language's evolution and are not necessarily available in earlier versions of TypeScript.
In other words, if you're using the newest version of TypeScript, you have access to these features, but if you're using an earlier version, you might not have them. The "later" refers to the fact that these features were introduced in a later version of the language, specifically TypeScript 4.1.
To give you a better idea, here are some of the key features introduced in TypeScript 4.1:
Template Literal Types: Allow you to use template literals in type positions, enabling you to model functions that expect specific sets of strings.
Key Remapping in Mapped Types: Enables you to remap keys in mapped types using a new "as" clause, allowing for more flexibility in creating property names based on old ones.
Recursive Conditional Types: Allows conditional types to reference themselves within their branches, making it easier to write recursive type aliases.
These features are part of the language's ongoing evolution, and they're designed to make TypeScript more powerful and expressive. If you're using the newest version of TypeScript, you can take advantage of these features to improve your coding experience and write more robust, maintainable code.
