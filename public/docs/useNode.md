# Mastering the `useNode` Hook in Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript

## Introduction

The introduction of the App Router in Next.js 14 has brought about a significant shift in the way we build modern web applications. One of the key features of the App Router is the ability to leverage TypeScript for type-safe development, which can greatly improve the maintainability and scalability of your projects.

In this blog post, we'll explore how you can utilize the `useNode` hook in a Next.js 14 App Router application, specifically when working with a text editor or a similar component that requires dynamic content editing.

## Understanding the `useNode` Hook

The `useNode` hook is a custom hook that can be used to interact with the nodes or elements within a text editor or a similar component. It provides a way to retrieve and update the attributes of a specific node, which can be particularly useful when you need to synchronize the content between the editor and your application's state.

### Use Case: Text Editor Integration

Imagine you have a custom text editor component that is integrated into your Next.js 14 App Router application. This text editor allows users to edit and update the content of specific nodes or elements within the editor.

When the user makes changes to the content within the text editor, you need to update the corresponding attributes of the node that was edited. This is where the `useNode` hook can be helpful.

### Retrieving Static HTML Content

The `useNode` hook uses the `editor.view.nodeDOM(getPos())` method to retrieve the current HTML content of the node being edited. It then updates the `html` attribute of the node using the `updateAttributes` function provided in the `props`.

### Delayed Execution

To ensure that the node's DOM representation is fully updated before retrieving the content, the hook uses a `setTimeout` with a 100ms delay. This is a common technique to handle cases where the DOM might not be immediately available or updated.

## Implementing the `useNode` Hook in a Next.js 14 App Router Application

Let's dive into the implementation details of using the `useNode` hook in a Next.js 14 App Router application with TypeScript.

### Step 1: Create the `useNode` Hook

First, let's create the `useNode` hook in a separate file, such as `useNode.ts`:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

interface NodeProps {
  html: string;
  updateAttributes: (attributes: { html: string }) => void;
}

const useNode = (editor: any, getPos: () => number) => {
  const [node, setNode] = useState<NodeProps | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      const nodeDOM = editor.view.nodeDOM(getPos());
      if (nodeDOM) {
        setNode({
          html: nodeDOM.innerHTML,
          updateAttributes: (attributes) => {
            editor.view.dispatch(
              editor.state.tr.setNodeMarkup(getPos(), undefined, attributes)
            );
          },
        });
      }
    }, 100);

    return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [editor, getPos]);

  return node;
};

export default useNode;
```

In this implementation, the `useNode` hook takes two parameters:

1. `editor`: The instance of the text editor component.
2. `getPos`: A function that returns the current position of the node being edited.

The hook returns an object with two properties:

1. `html`: The current HTML content of the node.
2. `updateAttributes`: A function that can be used to update the attributes of the node, including the HTML content.

### Step 2: Integrate the `useNode` Hook in a Next.js 14 App Router Component

Now, let's integrate the `useNode` hook into a Next.js 14 App Router component, such as a custom text editor page or layout:

```typescript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import useNode from './useNode';

const TextEditorPage = () => {
  const [editor, setEditor] = useState<any>(null);
  const [selectedNode, setSelectedNode] = useState<number | null>(null);

  const handleNodeSelect = useCallback((pos: number) => {
    setSelectedNode(pos);
  }, []);

  const node = useNode(editor, () => selectedNode || 0);

  const handleContentUpdate = useCallback(() => {
    if (node) {
      node.updateAttributes({ html: node.html });
    }
  }, [node]);

  return (
    <div>
      <TextEditor
        ref={setEditor}
        onNodeSelect={handleNodeSelect}
        onContentUpdate={handleContentUpdate}
      />
      {node && (
        <div>
          <h3>Selected Node</h3>
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: node.html }} />
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TextEditorPage;
```

In this example, the `TextEditorPage` component manages the state of the text editor and the selected node. When a node is selected, the `handleNodeSelect` function is called, which updates the `selectedNode` state.

The `useNode` hook is then used to retrieve the current node's HTML content and the `updateAttributes` function. The `handleContentUpdate` function is called whenever the content needs to be updated, and it uses the `updateAttributes` function to synchronize the changes.

Finally, the component renders the text editor and displays the HTML content of the selected node.

## Handling Edge Cases and Optimizations

When working with the `useNode` hook in a Next.js 14 App Router application, you may encounter various edge cases and opportunities for optimization. Here are a few examples:

1. **Handling Null or Undefined Nodes**: Ensure that your application can handle cases where the `node` object is `null` or `undefined`, as this can happen if the node is not found or if the editor is not yet initialized.

2. **Debouncing Content Updates**: To prevent excessive updates and improve performance, you may want to debounce the `handleContentUpdate` function, which can be done using a custom hook or a library like `lodash.debounce`.

3. **Memoizing Callbacks**: Use `useCallback` to memoize the callback functions, such as `handleNodeSelect` and `handleContentUpdate`, to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Handling Undo/Redo Operations**: If your text editor supports undo and redo functionality, you'll need to ensure that the `useNode` hook correctly updates the node's attributes when these operations are performed.

5. **Integrating with Other Editor Features**: Depending on the complexity of your text editor, you may need to integrate the `useNode` hook with other features, such as formatting, inline styles, or collaborative editing.

By addressing these edge cases and optimizations, you can create a robust and efficient text editor integration within your Next.js 14 App Router application.

## Conclusion

The `useNode` hook can be a powerful tool when working with text editors or similar components that require dynamic content editing in a Next.js 14 App Router application. By leveraging this hook, you can seamlessly synchronize the content between the editor and your application's state, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Remember to consider the specific requirements of your application, handle edge cases, and optimize the performance of your text editor integration to create a truly exceptional user experience.
